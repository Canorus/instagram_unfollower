# small updates

This is a working code as of 11. Feb. 2021, tested with geckodriver 0.28.0 and Firefox 84.0.2, headless device running Ubuntu 18.04. This may or may not work in the future and you'll need to change some parts accordingly. Also **I am not responsible for any consequence of using code from this repository.**

# Instagram Unfollower
A Python script designed to unfollow users who you follow but they don't follow you back. Works with Selenium, without using Instagram API.

# How to Use it ?

You will run the program with main.py file, just open the code and change the username and password variables with your account's infos. It's best to have InstaUnfollower.py and main.py in the same directories.

# Requirements

1) Python 3.X on your device
2) Python version of Selenium should be installed  ( pip install selenium )
3) Geckodriver should be installed ( https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases )
4) geckodriver executable file should have been added on the PATH ( adding it on the PATH differs according to your OS)
5) Firefox Browser should be installed.
